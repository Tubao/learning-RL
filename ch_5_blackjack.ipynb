    "Example 5.1: Blackjack The object of the popular casino card game of blackjack is to obtain cards\n",
    "the sum of whose numerical values is as great as possible without exceeding 21. All face cards count as\n",
    "10, and an ace can count either as 1 or as 11. We consider the version in which each player competes\n",
    "independently against the dealer. The game begins with two cards dealt to both dealer and player. One\n",
    "of the dealer’s cards is face up and the other is face down. If the player has 21 immediately (an ace and\n",
    "a 10-card), it is called a natural. He then wins unless the dealer also has a natural, in which case the\n",
    "game is a draw. If the player does not have a natural, then he can request additional cards, one by one\n",
    "(hits), until he either stops (sticks) or exceeds 21 (goes bust). If he goes bust, he loses; if he sticks, then\n",
    "it becomes the dealer’s turn. The dealer hits or sticks according to a fixed strategy without choice: he\n",
    "sticks on any sum of 17 or greater, and hits otherwise. If the dealer goes bust, then the player wins;\n",
    "otherwise, the outcome—win, lose, or draw—is determined by whose final sum is closer to 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playing blackjack is naturally formulated as an episodic finite MDP. Each game of blackjack is an\n",
    "episode. Rewards of +1, −1, and 0 are given for winning, losing, and drawing, respectively. All rewards\n",
    "within a game are zero, and we do not discount (γ = 1); therefore these terminal rewards are also the\n",
    "returns. The player’s actions are to hit or to stick. The states depend on the player’s cards and the\n",
    "dealer’s showing card. We assume that cards are dealt from an infinite deck (i.e., with replacement) so\n",
    "that there is no advantage to keeping track of the cards already dealt. If the player holds an ace that he\n",
    "could count as 11 without going bust, then the ace is said to be usable. In this case it is always counted\n",
    "as 11 because counting it as 1 would make the sum 11 or less, in which case there is no decision to be\n",
    "made because, obviously, the player should always hit. Thus, the player makes decisions on the basis\n",
    "of three variables: his current sum (12–21), the dealer’s one showing card (ace–10), and whether or not\n",
    "he holds a usable ace. This makes for a total of 200 states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the policy that sticks if the player’s sum is 20 or 21, and otherwise hits. To find the state-\n",
    "value function for this policy by a Monte Carlo approach, one simulates many blackjack games using\n",
    "the policy and averages the returns following each state. Note that in this task the same state never\n",
    "recurs within one episode, so there is no difference between first-visit and every-visit MC methods. In\n",
    "this way, we obtained the estimates of the state-value function shown in Figure 5.1. The estimates for\n",
    "states with a usable ace are less certain and less regular because these states are less common. In any\n",
    "event, after 500,000 games the value function is very well approximated.\n"
